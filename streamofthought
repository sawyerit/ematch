Suggested keywords based on category for new offer.  
 - This could be a list of keywords already found for offers in that category plus some static
  - //db."collection".distinct("arrayName") gets all distinct values from the array for ALL documents in collection
 - That way we have a more stable list on which to match

When matching
 - Match on category first
 - Then match on keywords

Preferences page
 - Choose categories
 - Choose suggested keywords
 - Allow adding of own keywords
 
 
Offers need a location field. Preference for a consumer will be near zip code. 
Right now we can use the Merchant account zip code

When an offer is created, its assumed its live immediately, there is no start date right now
 - matching will need to happen as the same time as offer creation
 - emails need to be sent to any user who has a matching category & at least 1 keyword?? (threshold)

When My Offers page is loaded, automatic check performed for anything mathing. 
 - "Badge" showing number of matched offers on tab?
 - "remove" an offer, because it doesn't interest the user (can we learn preferences from this?)
